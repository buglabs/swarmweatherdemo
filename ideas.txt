Idears for BUGweather thingy

what this board can do:
barometric pressure
humidity
light sensor
temperature yo

other bug technologies we've got
GPS
Camera
...basically anything else

IDEAS:
1. motherbug swarm?
   -2+ motherbugs, both same graphic UI (see wiki page_
2. security swarm
   bugs in different places -> huge changes in light sensitivity
   takes a picture? motion sensing one->many
3. Weather Station
   sparkfun functions, different places, graph, predict
   good for zoos/aquariums that need to maintain a specific climate
4. Pandacam!
   take pictures (dare i say video?) where most motion/light is detected
   temperature could also work
5. Monitoring pedestrian traffic: stores and such
6. Taxi services: use gps to monitor taxis around the city
7. Energy conservation: turn off light if no movement-->brightness
   level
8.
