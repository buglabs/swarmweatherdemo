Ideas for BUGSwarmWeatherDemo

Sparkfun Board functions:
# Absolute barometric pressure accurate within +/-150 Pascal
# Relative humidity accurate within +/-2%
# Temperature accurate within +/-0.3 degrees C
# Ambient light sensor (analog level)

Other BUG technologies we have:
GPS
Camera
...basically anything else

Additional Functionality:
Could purchase wind direction / rain gauge

Swarm needs to demonstrate:
BUGs enterting / exiting swarm

Swarm
IDEAS:
1. MotherBUG Swarm
   	2+ Motherbugs, both same graphic UI (see wiki page for details)
2. Security Swarm
   	Bugs in different places that detect huge changes in light sensitivity
   	When this happens, camera could take a picture
	When one bug detects change in light sensitivity, alerts all bugs in swarm
	If one BUG exits the swarm...all other BUGs are alerted.
3. Weather Station
   	Sparkfun functions, different places, graph + predict
   	Good for zoos/aquariums that need to maintain a specific climate
4. Pandacam
   	Take pictures where most motion/light is detected
   	Temperature could also work
5. Monitoring pedestrian traffic: 
	Monitor the traffic of specific chains using the motion detector
6. Taxi services: 
	Use GPS to monitor taxis around the city
	Display areas of highest traffic / concentration
7. Energy conservation 
	Turn off light if no movement-->brightness level
	Turn off AC if temperature is sufficiently cool
